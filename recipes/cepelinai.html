    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Cepelinai are traditional Lithuanian dumplings made from potatoes and usually stuffed with ground meat, or sometimes cheese curd or mushrooms.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <h4>For the dough</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>6 lb potatoes (ideally russet or Idaho)</li>
        <li>1 pill vitamin C (or ½ lemon)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>For the filling</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (or pork)</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>For the gravy</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>4 oz. bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <h4>Dough</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes. Crush the vitamin C pill and place in a large mixing bowl. Alternatively, press the juice of half a lemon. </li>
        <li>Grate the raw potatoes with an electric or manual potato grater into the bowl. Regularly mix the potatoes so they do not turn dark.</li>
        <li>Place some of the grated potatoes into a cheesecloth over a separate bowl and squeeze until the potatoes are almost dry. Repeat with the remaining grated potatoes.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour away the potato juice from the bowl to collect the layer of potato starch settled at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Incorporate the potato starch with the drained grated potatoes, add salt and knead until well combined.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the ground beef (or pork), chopped onions, pepper and salt. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Fill a large stockpot with water, add 1 tablespoon of salt, and bring to a boil. </li>
        <li>Take a portion (size of a tennis ball) of the potato dough and flatten in your hands. Take a smaller portion (size of a golf ball) of the meat filling and put in the center.</li>
        <li>Fold the potato dough to seal the dumpling and form the shape of a zeppelin. Repeat with the remaining dough and meat.</li>
        <li>Once the water comes to boil, reduce heat to medium and slowly lower the cepelinai into the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Boil for <strong>20 minutes </strong> or until the meat filling is cooked through. Carefully remove the dumplings from the stockpot with a slotted spoon.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Gravy</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Add the diced bacon and chopped onions into a large frying pan. Sauté on medium heat for about <strong>8 to 10 minutes</strong>. Add salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off, then add the sour cream. Mix well and thin the gravy with a little hot water or chicken stock if necessary.</li>
        <li>Serve the cepelinai generously topped with the gravy.</li>
    </ol>
