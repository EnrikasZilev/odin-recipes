    <h1>Tacros (Croissant Tacos)</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Behold the best mashup ever, the <strong>croissant taco!</strong> 
        Fine masa harina in the croissant dough results in flaky layers with a chewy interior. 
        They're dense on the inside -- the better to hold the fillings -- 
        but if you prefer a more tender, croissant-type texture, 
        decrease the masa, increase the bread flour, and omit the gluten.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups masa harina</li>
            <li>½ cup boiling water</li>
            <li>12 ounces bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt </li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast</li>
            <li>12 ounces milk</li>
            <li>2 ounces lard</li>
            <li>10 ounces butter, room temperature</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine masa harina and boiling water in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix until crumbly and set aside to soften for a few minutes. Combine bread flour, gluten, sugar, salt, and yeast in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour milk into the bowl with the masa; add flour mixture and lard. Mix on low speed with the dough hook until dough is well combined and clears the sides of the bowl, about <strong>2 minutes. </strong> Scrape dough down and mix for <strong>5 minutes </strong> more to develop the gluten; dough will be very stiff.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature, about <strong> 1 1/2 hours. </strong> Place butter in the same mixing bowl and use the paddle attachment on low speed to break it up. Mix just until smooth.</li>
            <li>Scrape butter onto a piece of parchment or waxed paper. Form into a 7-inch square. Cover with another piece of parchment and smooth the top with a rolling pin. Re-form the edges of your square if necessary; a little fussing now will save you some trouble later on as you roll out the dough. Place butter square in the refrigerator to chill.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough onto a floured work surface. Pat it into a square, transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for <strong>1 to 24 hours.</strong></li>
            <li>Remove butter square from the refrigerator about <strong>20 minutes </strong>before you plan to roll the dough; it needs to be cool and pliable.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough onto a floured work surface. Roll it into a square a little larger than the butter square. Leaving a 7-inch square platform in the center for the butter, roll each of the 4 corners of dough out into elongated flaps that can wrap around the butter like a present.</li>
            <li>Place butter square in the center of the dough, fold up the flaps, and pinch together to seal. Roll dough out into a rectangle. Fold in thirds, like a business letter. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for <strong> 30 minutes. </strong></strong></li>
            <li>Return dough to the work surface; dust with flour if needed. Roll dough out into a longer rectangle; you're going to do a 4-fold, also called the "book fold." Fold the left edge of the dough into the center of the rectangle; fold the right side in to meet it. Then fold it in half again, like a wallet. Return dough to the parchment-lined baking pan, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for <strong>30 minutes.</strong></li>
            <li>Place dough on the work surface, roll out into a rectangle again, and make the final turn: another 3-fold, like a business letter. Cover and return to the refrigerator for <strong>30 minutes</strong>; the dough can also be frozen at this point.</li>
            <li>Slice dough in half and return 1 piece to the refrigerator to stay cool. Roll dough out to 1/4-inch thickness. Use a cutter to create 5-inch circles. Transfer circles to a parchment-lined baking sheet and let rise for <strong>1 hour. </strong> Shape dough scraps into "tacro cups" and place in the cups of a muffin tin; let rise. Repeat both steps with remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to <strong>350 degrees F (175 degrees C) </strong>. Gently fold a dough circle in half to form a taco shell shape; holding it with tongs, lower it into the oil. Hold it closed for about <strong>10 seconds. </strong> Fry 2 shells at a time until golden, turning once, about <strong>3 minutes </strong> total. Repeat with remaining dough circles, maintaining the oil heat between <strong>350 and 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</strong> Drain tacro shells on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </strong></strong></li>
            <li>Bake tacro cups in the muffin tin until golden, <strong>15 to 18 minutes.</strong> Fill cups and shells with your favorite taco fillings.</li>
